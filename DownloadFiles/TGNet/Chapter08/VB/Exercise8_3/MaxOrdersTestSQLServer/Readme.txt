This solution presumes
that SQL Server has 
been installed on your system.
The actual exercise in the
book uses Microsoft Access.
You will find the answer to that 
in the other folder in the
Exercise9-3 directory
"MaxOrdersTestAccess".
This is here since
there is a listing 
in the book that also shows
SQL Server.
